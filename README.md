# Hi there, I'm Sean Coutinho - CEO of Bytestream Technologies! 👋

I'm a seasoned **Full Stack Developer** with a passion for crafting dynamic, user-centric applications. My journey in the tech world is powered by Next.js, and I'm a strong advocate for TypeScript, ensuring my code is robust and reliable. 🚀

## What I Do
- 🌐 **Front-end Mastery:** Next.js is my playground, where I build seamless, performant web experiences.
- 🔧 **Backend Expertise:** I design and implement robust APIs with Node.js and Express, ensuring everything runs smoothly under the hood.
- 🛠️ **DevOps Enthusiast:** With **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, I bring projects to life, scaling them effortlessly in the cloud.
- 🗄️ **Database Aficionado:** I work with both **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases, choosing the right tool for the job every time.
- 🧩 **API Architect:** Crafting efficient, powerful APIs with **GraphQL** is one of my favorite things to do.
- 📦 **Supabase Wizard:** Leveraging the power of Supabase for real-time, scalable applications is my jam.
- 🛡️ TypeScript Advocate: I love TypeScript for the safety and clarity it brings to my code, minimizing bugs and maximizing productivity.

## My Code, My Craft
Code isn't just something I write; it's something I *craft*. I believe in clean, maintainable code that doesn't just work but works beautifully. Whether it's building a complex API or designing a pixel-perfect UI, I approach every project with creativity and precision.

## Fun Facts 🎉
- I believe that coding is a perfect blend of logic and creativity—like solving a puzzle where you get to design the pieces.
- When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring the latest tech trends, playing video games, or catching up on some sci-fi novels.
